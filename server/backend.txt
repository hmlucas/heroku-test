General Structure:
/app - contains all backend functions
    /models - models are like a class representation of a database entity.
              they contain the entity's attributes and functions to print/get
              object as a dictionary. if you want to see a table's structure for
              reference then go here.
    /repos - this is where the actual functions for queries are implemented.
             query functions are organized by object. unless you're writing a
             new query function then don't worry about the implementation here,
             just use the appropriate api calls
    /api - contains api calls (uses repo functions), to get routes see
            /api/api_wiki.txt
